The Tube

A freeware minimalistic youtube browser based on youtube-dl 
and mplayer.

On start-up you can choose whether you want playback on the 
tv-out (in which case you should select HW layer in the tv-out 
configuration). There is alo an option to update the included 
youtube-dl should that become necessary.

You can use the mouse or the keyboard for input. Press h or the 
help button to get help on the keyboard shortcuts. Videos can be 
played from the browser by double clicking or pressing enter, or 
downloaded by pressing <d>. Currently it needs mplayer installed 
(which can be done with the community codec pack, 
http://openpandora.org/downloads/CodecPack.pnd). The 
preferred quality of playback can be selected - it will fallback 
on lower bitrates if the preferred option is not available.
